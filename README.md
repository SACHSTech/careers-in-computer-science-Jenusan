## **_The basics_**
### **_What is a video game developer?_**
* Video game developers help transform games from a concept to a playable reality. They do this by coding visual elements, programming features, and testing iterations until a game is ready for market. If you love video games and enjoy working with computers, a career in video game development can be immensely rewarding.
### **_what education will a video game develeoper usually have?_**
* Most game software developers have a formal education background, with at least a bachelor's degree. Employers tend to prefer candidates who have completed four-year degree courses as they have a more in-depth scientific grounding that is necessary for game development.

### **_What kind of technical and non technical skills will be expected?_**
* Creativity.
* A passion for video games.
* Wide-ranging knowledge of gaming trends.
* Strong analytical frame of mind.
* Ability to work as part of a team.
* Proficiency in programming languages, such as C# and C++
### **_(Now for the important part) What is the expected salary?_**

<font size = "10">$67,500 average salary
<font size = "2">

## **_Standard Education_**

### **_McMaster University_**

#### Expected average of 90-96 for acceptance 

### **_Prerequisites_**

* Grade12 English 
* Grade12 Calculus and Vectors 
* 2 of  Grade12 Chemistry  or  Grade12 Biology  or  Grade12 Physics  or  Grade12 Earth and Space Science 
* Applicants are required to have at least six Grade 12 U/M level courses, including: ENG4U, MCV4U, and two of: SBI4U, SCH4U, SPH4U, SES4U, ICS4U, TEJ4M.

### **_First year courses_**
Your course load should be balanced between Fall and Winter Terms. A full course load is typically 5 courses (15 units per term) but depending on your schedule, you may consider taking a reduced course load of 4 courses per term (12 units per term).

* Discrete Mathematics for Computer Science (COMPSCI 1DM3)
* Introduction to Computational Thinking (COMPSCI 1JC3)
* Introduction to Programming (COMPSCI 1MD3)
* Computer Science Practice and Experience: Development Basics (COMPSCI 1XC3)
* Computer Science Practice and Experience: Introduction to Software Design Using Web Programming (COMPSCI 1XD3)
* Linear Algebra I (MATH 1B03)
* Engineering Mathematics I (MATH 1ZA3)
* Engineering Mathematics II-A (MATH 1ZB3)
* 6 units of electives

### **_Length_**
McMasters computer science diploma takes 4 years to acquire, and usually will not require any other graduate courses to enter the workforce 

## **_Experiential Learning_**
Other than traditional schooling (a scam), there are other ways that someone with no school education on computer science can beocme computer scientists, like; 

* coding bootcamp - coding bootcamps teach from basic coding to advanced methods 
* self starter projects - by creating an advanced code and continously devloping it, employers can look at self started projects to judge the skills you have as a programmer
* co op programs and internships- many tech firms and businesses offer co op programs so that students can learn about real programming work done in the workforce, giving them an edge on experience 
* Hackathons- Hackathons are coding competitions that are held by schools, or organizations, and are a good way to show of your coding skills, and are recognized by schools and companies to find new developers
